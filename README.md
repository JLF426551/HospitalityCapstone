**Shifting Travel and Tourism Consumer Groups**

_Background_

On March 11, 2020 WHO made the assessment that COVID-19 could be characterized as a pandemic.

Since the pandemic began, aviation passenger traffic declined by 60 percent in 2020. International tourism recorded its worst year ever on record – a decline of 74 percent (CCSA, 2021). This decline represents a loss of an estimated 1.3 trillion USD in international tourism expenditure, about 11 times the loss of the 2009 global crisis (CCSA, 2021). 

From past literature, consumers seem place safety and risk perception as the most important factor in deciding to engage in public activities – including travel. As the economy “reopens” and customers and businesses embrace a new normal, it is key for travel and tourism businesses – inclusive of travel, hospitality, and restaurant industries - to understand their consumers.

Related to travel and hospitality there are three periods that surround coronavirus. The “old normal” before COVID-19 was identified in China. The “new normal” period, which started with the full declaration of coronavirus as a pandemic. In the United States, lockdowns and travel restrictions were put into place. The next period would be the transition period into the “return to normal” stage which is characterized by the development of the coronavirus vaccine. 

_Data and Goals_

The data used for analysis of traveler sentiment and groups is gathered from two periods: June 2020, and December 2020. The June 2020 period allows for a three-month period of adaptation into the “new normal.” With the December 2020 period data, we can conduct an analysis of change in sentiment around two factors: an increase in number of cases; and, the development and rollout of the coronavirus vaccine.

The goals of the study are to identify: 1) Distinct consumer groups; 2) The factors that would best promote a sense of safety and engage travelers and tourists within each cluster; and, 3) Any shifts in cluster composition from the June 2020 to the December 2020 period.
